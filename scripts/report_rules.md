# Report logic (reference)

- Heavy crowd:
  - Position percentile ≥ 85% (crowded long) or ≤ 15% (crowded short) over a 3-year window.
  - Confirm with OI percentile ≥ 70% when open interest is present.
- Alignment/divergence:
  - Aligned = LF and AM same sign → continuation bias.
  - Divergent = opposite signs → mean-reversion/squeeze risk; wait for price structure.
- Bias mapping:
  - Aligned longs → Buy dips (cautious if crowded).
  - Aligned shorts → Sell rallies (cautious if crowded).
  - Divergent AM long/LF short → Range with upside squeeze risk.
  - Divergent AM short/LF long → Range with downside risk.
- Charts:
  - Show net positions with horizontal lines at 15th/85th percentiles to visualize reversal zones.
